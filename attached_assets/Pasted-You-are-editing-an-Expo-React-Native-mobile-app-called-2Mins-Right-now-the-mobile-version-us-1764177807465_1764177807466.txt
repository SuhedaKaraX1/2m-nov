You are editing an Expo React Native mobile app called **2Mins**.  
Right now the mobile version uses a **bottom tab bar** (Home / Challenges / Progress / Profile).  
I want you to **remove the bottom tab bar completely** and replace it with a **hamburger menu + sidebar drawer**, just like the left sidebar on my web app.

## Goal

- Add a **hamburger icon** in the top-left of the app header on every main screen.
- When the user taps the hamburger icon, open a **sidebar drawer menu**.
- The drawer menu should contain **the same pages and structure as the web app sidebar**, and each page’s **content and functionality** should match the web version as closely as possible, but in a mobile-friendly layout.

## Tech requirements

- This is an Expo React Native app (TypeScript or JavaScript – keep whatever the project already uses).
- Use **React Navigation** with a **Drawer navigator** (`@react-navigation/drawer`) instead of the current bottom tab navigator.
- Keep all existing business logic, state, API calls, and styling tokens (colors, spacing, fonts) that the project already has.
- Only change navigation and layout structure; do NOT break any existing features.

## Navigation structure

Replace the bottom tab bar with a drawer that has these items, in this order:

**Navigation**
1. Home  
2. My Challenges  
3. Progress  
4. Journal  
5. Friends  
6. Profile  
7. Settings  

**Create**
8. New Challenge  
9. My Custom Challenges  

Visually, it should resemble the web sidebar:

- A vertical list on the left when opened.
- The currently selected item is highlighted.
- Sections “Navigation” and “Create” can be separated by a small gap or subtle label, similar to the web UI.

## Screen mapping and content

Use the existing mobile components where possible, but make each screen’s content **match the web app screenshots** I provided:

### 1. Home
- Show the **2Mins header** and summary stats at the top:
  - Current streak (e.g., “1 day streak” on mobile, “Current Streak 1 days” on web)
  - Total points (e.g., “60 Points”)
  - Completed challenges (e.g., “2 Completed”)
- Below that, show **Today’s / Featured Challenge** card:
  - Title, category (e.g., “Relationships”), description, difficulty, points, and a “Start Challenge” button.
- Below that, show **Explore Categories** cards (Physical, Mental, Learning, Finance, Relationships, Extreme, etc.) similar to the web: full-width or 2-columns grid, but responsive.
- Make the whole screen scrollable with a `ScrollView`.

### 2. My Challenges
- Show a page like the web **All Challenges** screen:
  - Page title: “All Challenges”.
  - Category filter chips at the top: All, Physical, Mental, Learning, Finance, Relationships, Extreme.
  - Under the filters, list challenge cards (e.g., “Desk Stretch Series”, “Two-Minute Walk”, etc.) with:
    - Title
    - Category
    - Short description
    - Points
    - Duration
    - Difficulty badge (Easy / Medium / Hard)
    - “Start Challenge” button.
- Make it scrollable vertically.

### 3. Progress
- Create a **Progress / Analytics** screen mirroring the web version:
  - Top cards:
    - Total Challenges (e.g., 6 completed)
    - Last 30 Days (challenges completed)
    - Categories explored.
  - Tabs or segmented controls for **Daily / Trends / Categories** (can be simple buttons).
  - Charts:
    - Daily Activity (Last 30 Days) – bar chart of challenges per day.
    - Points Earned (Last 30 Days) – line chart of points per day.
  - Below the charts, show **Challenge History** list:
    - Each item: challenge name, category, date, time spent, points, difficulty badge.
- Implement charts using any lightweight React Native chart library already in the project; if none exists, add a simple one that works with Expo (e.g., `react-native-chart-kit`) and keep styles minimal.

### 4. Journal
- Recreate the web **Journal** layout in a mobile-friendly way:
  - Title: “Journal”.
  - On mobile, stack vertically instead of a wide 3-column layout.
  - Top area showing entries list:
    - If there are no entries, show a “No entries yet” placeholder text.
  - Below or via a button “New Entry”, show inputs:
    - Title
    - Date picker (today’s date by default)
    - Tags (comma-separated)
    - Text area for the note content
    - Optional media/file upload (image, video, audio, PDF).
    - Optional voice recording button/section.
  - Use scrollable view; adapt input sizes for small screens.

### 5. Friends
- Screen similar to the web **Friends** page:
  - “Add Friend” card with an email input (`friend@example.com`) and “Send Request” button.
  - “Your Friends” section with list of friends. If there are none, show “No friends yet – Add friends to see their activity and compete!”.
  - “Friend Activity” card showing recent challenge activity by friends (or “No recent activity” when empty).

### 6. Profile
- Mirror the **Profile** screen on web:
  - Section: “Personal Information” with avatar, name, email, username/handle.
  - Section: “Your Stats” showing:
    - Challenges
    - Current Streak
    - Longest Streak
    - Total Points.
  - Section: “Your Preferences”:
    - Preferred Categories (e.g., physical, finance, extreme) as tags/chips.
    - Challenge Days (e.g., Sat, Sun) as selectable badges.
- All stacked vertically, scrollable.

### 7. Settings
- Screen like web **Settings** → “Challenge Scheduling”:
  - Toggle “Enable scheduled notifications”.
  - Time range pickers for **Active Time Slots** (e.g., 09:00 to 17:00, with “+ Add Time Slot” button).
  - “Save Changes” button.
- At the bottom, add a **Danger Zone** section:
  - “Delete Account” button with appropriate warning text.

### 8. New Challenge
- Screen to create a new challenge, according to the existing logic in the project:
  - Basic fields: title, category, difficulty, description, points, duration, etc.
  - “Save” or “Create Challenge” button.
- Reuse any existing forms/components related to challenge creation.

### 9. My Custom Challenges
- Show a list of user-created challenges:
  - Title, category, difficulty, points.
  - Edit / Delete actions if they exist in the current codebase.
- Scrollable list.

## UX & styling

- Maintain the current **color palette**, typography, and button styles from the existing mobile app (blue primary buttons, white cards with rounded corners, etc.).
- All screens must be **fully scrollable** and look good on common phone widths.
- Do not leave the old bottom tab bar. After your changes, **navigation must be entirely via the hamburger + drawer**.
- Ensure back navigation works correctly (e.g., using the default app header with a back button when navigating deep into sub-screens, if any).

## Implementation details

1. Install and configure `@react-navigation/drawer` if not already installed.
2. Replace the bottom tab navigator in the root navigation file with a Drawer navigator.
3. Add the hamburger icon to the header using `headerLeft` and connect it to `navigation.openDrawer()`.
4. Register each screen (Home, MyChallenges, Progress, Journal, Friends, Profile, Settings, NewChallenge, MyCustomChallenges) as a separate route in the Drawer.
5. Reuse as much existing screen/component code as possible; just refactor it into separate screen components if needed.
6. Ensure the app builds and runs on Expo with no TypeScript/ESLint errors.

Please update the codebase to implement this drawer-based navigation and page layouts exactly as described, keeping the page content consistent with the web UI but optimized for mobile.
