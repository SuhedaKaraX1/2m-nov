You are an AI pair programmer inside a Replit monorepo.

This project currently has:
- A fully working **web application** (React/Next or similar) in the root of the repo.
- A separate **mobile application** in the `mobile/` folder, built with React Native and Expo.
- A Supabase backend that is already integrated and working in the web app.

Goal:
Create a **feature-complete mobile version** of the existing web app, using the code in this repo as the single source of truth. The mobile app must have the **same pages, flows, and core features** as the web app (authentication, database operations, navigation, etc.), adapted to mobile UX.

### High-level tasks

1. **Understand the existing web app**
   - Scan the codebase outside of `/mobile` and identify:
     - Routing structure (pages, routes, layouts).
     - Main features and flows (login, register, logout, profile, listing/detail pages, dashboards, forms, etc.).
     - How Supabase is initialized and used (client creation, auth, database queries).
     - Shared UI components, hooks, services, and utilities that can be reused.
   - Make sure you understand where the “source of truth” logic lives (for example: `src/`, `pages/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `services/`).

2. **Design the mobile architecture**
   - Treat `/mobile` as a React Native + Expo app.
   - Set up navigation with React Navigation (stack/tab navigation) that mirrors the web app’s page structure:
     - Each main web page should correspond to a screen in the mobile app.
     - Preserve the same URL/route semantics conceptually but adapt them to mobile navigation.
   - Reuse as much business logic as possible from the web app:
     - Shared hooks (e.g. useAuth, useSupabase, useApi, etc.).
     - Shared service modules for API and Supabase queries.
     - Shared validation logic, schemas, and types.

3. **Implement Supabase integration in the mobile app**
   - In `/mobile`, create or update a Supabase client that:
     - Uses the same Supabase project (URL and keys provided through environment variables).
     - Uses the same auth mechanisms (email/password, magic link, OAuth, etc.), matching what the web app does.
   - Make sure **no secrets are hard-coded**; read them from environment variables configured in Replit/Expo.
   - Ensure that login, logout, session handling and protected routes/screens work the same way as on the web.

4. **Port each major feature from web to mobile**
   For each major feature in the web app (for example):
   - Authentication (sign up, login, logout, forgot password).
   - Profile / account pages.
   - Listing pages (e.g. list of items, posts, records).
   - Detail pages (e.g. item detail, post detail).
   - Forms and actions (create / update / delete).
   - Any dashboards, analytics views or specific workflows that exist on the web.
   
   Do the following:
   - Create a corresponding React Native screen component in `/mobile` that:
     - Calls the **same underlying logic** (hooks/services) as the web version, or a refactored shared version.
     - Preserves the same data flow and business rules.
     - Adapts the UI to mobile (ScrollView, safe areas, touchable components, etc.).
   - If web-specific UI components cannot be used directly (e.g. HTML elements, web-only libraries), extract and reuse only the **logic**, and replace the UI with native equivalents.

5. **Refactor for shared code where needed**
   - If logic is duplicated between web and mobile, extract that logic into a shared module (for example, a `shared/` or `src/shared/` folder) and import it from both web and mobile.
   - Do **not** break the working web app while refactoring. Changes must be backwards compatible.
   - Make sure TypeScript types/interfaces (if used) are shared and consistent.

6. **Maintain consistent behavior and UX**
   - The mobile app should behave the same way as the web app:
     - Same validations and error messages.
     - Same permissions/authorization checks.
     - Same data displayed (from Supabase).
   - UI does not have to be pixel-perfect identical, but the **flows and functionalities must be equivalent**.

7. **Testing and cleanup**
   - After implementing each major screen/feature, verify that:
     - The mobile app builds and runs with Expo.
     - Navigation works without errors.
     - Supabase operations (login, fetch, insert, update, delete) work correctly.
   - Remove unused placeholder code in `/mobile` that is no longer needed.

### What to do now

1. Start by scanning the repo and summarizing:
   - The main routes/pages of the web app.
   - The main features and flows.
2. Propose a navigation structure for the mobile app based on the web routes.
3. Then, step by step, implement the mobile screens and logic, starting with:
   - Supabase setup in `/mobile`.
   - Auth screens (login/register).
   - The most important core user flow.

Make all changes directly in the code under `/mobile` (and, if needed, shared folders), while ensuring that the existing web application continues to work as before.
